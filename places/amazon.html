    <h2>Amazon Rainforest</h2>
    <p>
      The Amazon Rainforest, often called the “Lungs of the Earth,” is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, 
      stretching across nine South American countries. It is home to an extraordinary diversity of plants, 
      animals, and indigenous cultures that make it one of the most fascinating places on Earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mighty Amazon River flows through this lush jungle, offering visitors breathtaking boat journeys, 
      opportunities to spot exotic wildlife such as pink dolphins, jaguars, and colorful macaws, 
      and a chance to experience life in remote rainforest lodges.
