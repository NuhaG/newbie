    <h2>Aurora Borealis</h2>
    <p>
      The Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, is one of nature’s most magical displays. 
      Dancing waves of green, purple, and pink light illuminate the polar skies, creating an unforgettable spectacle. 
      This natural phenomenon is caused by solar particles colliding with Earth’s magnetic field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best places to see the aurora are in Arctic regions such as Norway, Iceland, Canada, and Finland, 
      where the dark winter nights provide a perfect canvas for this breathtaking show.
